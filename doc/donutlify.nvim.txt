**Donutlify** is a fun Neovim plugin that transforms your buffer text into the
shape of a donut! The usage is the same as `center` command (see |:center|).

The plugin creates as many donuts as possible with the given diameter and
crafts a smaller donut from any remaining text. Bring some sweetness to your
coding with Donutlify!


HOWTO USE                            *donutlify.nvim-donutlify.nvim-howto-use*

`:[range]Donutlify [diameter]` Combine lines in `[range]` in the shape of the
donut with `[diameter]` characters in diameter (by default `'textwidth'` or 80
when `'textwidth'` is 0). If `[range]` is not specified, format the entire
buffer.
